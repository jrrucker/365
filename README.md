# 365

The was a photo project I started originally intended as a 365 day portait project.  Given the time commitment -- I decided to pursue a less rigorous photo project.  I currently post photos at www.joshrucker.com via Squarespace.

I've abandoned this project, but if you'd like to use it feel free to do so under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
