		<p>The 365 project is a portrait photography project where I take a portrait of a different 
			individual everyday for a year. The project is inspired by other 365 projects (including 
			Bill Wadman&rsquo;s <a href="http://365portraits.com/">365 Portraits</a>). The rules are 
			simple: 1) shoot a portrait everyday and 2) never shoot the same person twice.</p>
