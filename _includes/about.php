		<p>This project (formerly the 365/52 project) is a collection of portraits taken by me.  The collection includes portraits
			of friends, family members, coworkers, and acquaintances published at whatever interval suits me. The project is inspired by 
			365 and 52 week projects (including Bill Wadman&rsquo;s <a href="http://365portraits.com/">365 Portraits</a>). There are
			no rules.</p>
